pyHeliosphere
=============

VOX file read and Mayavi plotting

pyHeliosphere might oneday become a collection of code to read in and display tomographically reconstructed number density and velocity data of the inner heliosphere.

Currently there exists a read routine to read in the volume data from the .vox files and a basic plotting routine using MayaVi2

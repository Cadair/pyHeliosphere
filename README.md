pyHeliosphere
=============

pyHeliosphere might oneday become a collection of code to read in and display tomographically reconstructed number density and velocity data of the inner heliosphere. Then maybe it will have routines to do volume calculations on selected volumes.

Currently there exists a read routine to read in the volume data from the .vox files and a basic plotting routine using MayaVi2
